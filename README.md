# 🪔 Diwali Sales Data Analysis

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of retail sales data collected during the Indian Diwali festival season. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, the analysis dives into customer behavior, purchase trends, and revenue breakdowns to understand how different demographics contributed to sales during this major shopping period.

## 📚 Project Overview

The **objective** of this project is to analyze Diwali sales data to uncover insights such as:

* Which **customer segments** generate the most revenue?
* Which **states, age groups, and genders** contribute most to sales?
* What are the **purchase patterns** across different demographics?
* How can businesses leverage this analysis for **targeted marketing** during festive seasons?

This kind of analysis is valuable for **retailers**, **marketing teams**, and **e-commerce platforms** aiming to optimize their strategies around high-demand events like Diwali.

## 📦 Dataset Information

The dataset used is titled **Diwali Sales Data** and includes columns such as:

* `Gender`
* `Age Group`
* `State`
* `Marital Status`
* `Orders`
* `Amount`

The data was cleaned by:

* Dropping irrelevant columns like `Status` and `unnamed1`
* Handling missing values
* Converting the `Amount` field to integers for aggregation

---

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored

1. Do men or women spend more during Diwali?
2. Which age group contributes most to the revenue?
3. What are the top-performing states in terms of orders and amount?
4. Is marital status a factor in spending behavior?
5. Which combinations of demographics result in the highest sales?

## 📊 Visualizations and Techniques

The project uses several powerful data visualization techniques to support the findings:

* **Countplots** to show category frequencies
* **Bar plots** to show grouped aggregations (e.g., total amount by gender/state)
* **Groupby and sorting** to rank sales performance by various fields
* **Matplotlib + Seaborn** for clear, professional-looking charts

These visuals help transform raw numbers into actionable insights.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

* `pandas` – for data cleaning and manipulation
* `numpy` – for numerical operations
* `matplotlib` – for static plotting
* `seaborn` – for styled, statistical visualizations
* `Jupyter Notebook` – for interactive code and visual storytelling

---

## 📈 Summary of Insights

* **Males** were observed to spend slightly more than females during the Diwali season.
* The **26–35 age group** dominated the spending behavior.
* **Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh** were top-performing states in both orders and revenue.
* **Married individuals**, particularly married males, were key contributors to overall spending.

These insights help businesses plan more effective **promotional campaigns, inventory stocking, and customer targeting strategies** for future festive seasons.
